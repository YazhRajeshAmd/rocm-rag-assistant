RAG Implementation Framework 

System Architecture 

The diagram below illustrates the architecture of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system, a framework designed to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) outputs with external knowledge.  

 

The process is divided into two primary flows:  

Data Preparation (left side, labelled A, B, C)  

Retrieval Augmented Generation (right side, labelled 1-5). 

Data Preparation Workflow: 

Raw Data Sources (A) 

The process begins with the ingestion of raw data from various sources. 

Information Extraction (B) 

Relevant information is extracted using methods such as CR, PDF extraction, web crawlers, etc. 

Chunking (C) and Embeddings 

The extracted content is divided into smaller, manageable chunks and transformed into embeddings – numerical representations of the text – for use in vector-based retrieval.  

Retrieval Augmented Generation Workflow: 

Query Embedding: 

An incoming query is converted into an embedding. 

Vector Search: 

The query embedding is used to search against the precomputed document embeddings in a vector database.  

Relevant Data Retrieval: 

The system retrieves the most relevant pieces of content based on similarity to the query. 

Context Injection: 

Retrieved content is fed into the LLM along with the original query. 

LLM Response Generation: 

The LLM generates a context aware response using the query and the externa knowledge provided. 

The Vector Database serves as a central hub, storing the embedded documents from the data preparation phase and facilitating efficient semantic search when queries are received. 

 

 

Key Components 

LangChain: Orchestrating the RAG workflow. 

Ollama: Serving multiple LLM instances. 

Hugging Face Embeddings: Converting text to vector representations. 

Chroma: Vector database for efficient similarity search 

Gradio: User interface for interaction 

 

Demonstrating RAG Capabilities: A Performance Focused Multi-Model Design 

Overview 

To highlight the capabilities of AMD's MI300X platform, we've developed an advanced demonstration that not only runs multiple Large Language Models simultaneously but also provides detailed performance metrics for each model's operation. This enhanced version allows users to both compare resaponses and analyze the performance characteristics of different AI models in real-time. 

Technology in Action 

The demonstration design creates an interactive dashboard with two main components: 

A multi-model chat interface featuring four different LLM models: 

Mixtral (8x7B parameters) 

Llama 3.1 (8B parameters) 

Gemma 2 (27B parameters) 

Phi 3 (14B parameters) 

 

A performance metrics panel that provides real-time statistics for each query, including: 

Token counts for input and output. 

Retrieval time for finding relevant information. 

Inference time for generating responses. 

Processing speed in tokens per second

Demo Deployment Instructions 

*Note: For AMD Sales/Marketing, skip to step 5.  Schedule time on TME representative calendar (typically Yazhini Rajesh) to launch the demo (while connected to AMD VPN) and then bring up web browser pointed to web site TME rep provides. 

Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment 

First, ensure your system has the following prerequisites installed: 

AMD ROCm 

Python 3.8 or higher 

Ollama (once downloaded, run the below to install):  

curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh 

Retrieve RAG code from AMD Github:  

Step 2: Installing Requirements 

Open your terminal and install the necessary Python packages using the requirements.txt file in AMD Github repo: 

pip install -r requirements.txt 

Step 3: Installing the AI Models 

Using Ollama, install each required model: 

ollama pull mixtral:8x7b 
ollama pull llama3.1:8b 
ollama pull gemma2:27b 
ollama pull phi3:14b 

Step 4: Running the Demo 

Save the provided code to instinct_chat_4LLM_4GPU_metrics.py 

In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the file (e.g., cd rag_workflow/) 

Run the demo: python instinct_chat_4LLM_4GPU_metrics.py 

The system will: 

Gather information from the ROCm documentation website. 

Set up the vector database for information retrieval. 

Launch a web interface with the performance monitoring dashboard. 

The server will start on http://localhost:7860/ (replace localhost with your server IP address) 

Step 5: Accessing the UI 

To access the demo, use the server IP address and the port 7860 ( http://ip_address:7860 replace ip_address with your server IP address). You will be able to see: 

Four chat windows, each representing a different AI model 

A performance metrics panel on the right side 

A question input box at the bottom 

Pre-configured example questions to get started. 

 

To try the demo, enter a question in the question box at bottom and hit <Enter> key. 

**Please Note: If the models have not been previously loaded on GPU’s, the initial question will take 2-3x longer (approx. 3-4mins) to execute as the system is initializing and loading respective models. Subsequent questions should be processed significantly faster.
